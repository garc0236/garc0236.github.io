            <p>I am a Colombian guy who is changing somehow his career path because for me is interesting how things are changing so rapidly with technology and all involved in this field, like designing but now through computerized aid and programming software.This is what got my attention to this program.</p>
            
            <p>Back in my home country, I was struggling trying to find a job in my bachelorâ€™s degree in International Economic Affairs which I got the 5<sup>th</sup> of June of 2014, but since I graduated from that year, I was doing other jobs that were not related to my true career, so that is why I decided to change entirely my whole life by coming to study here this program.</p>

            <p>A great quote that could explain what I felt at that <em>exact moment</em> that I made this decision is:</p>
